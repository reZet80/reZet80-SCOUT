------------------------------------------------------

The Z80 is the heart of the system.
All 40 CPU pins are connected to the bus.

The bus signals BUSACK, BUSREQ, HALT, INT, NMI, RFSH and WAIT are optional
and can be used for user-defined purposes.

Check the reZet80 CPU bus specs R2 (specs_CPU_bus).

6 resistors 4k7 are used to pull the signals BUSREQ, CLK, INT, NMI, RESET
and WAIT high.

Additionally an oscillator is available on the mainboard.
With the help of a jumper 2 different clock speeds and 3 configurations
are possible:
- Mainboard oscillator for the entire system
- An external oscillator for the entire system
- Mainboard oscillator only for the CPU and an external oscillator for the
rest of the system

Bill of materials:
- DIP-40 socket (optional)
- DIP-8 or DIP-14 socket (depending on oscillator size, optional)
- Z80 CPU (NMOS)
- 2 MHz oscillator (DIP-8 or DIP-14)
- 6x resistor 4k7 (or 10k)
- 2x capacitor 100 nF
- 8x jumper wire (optional)
