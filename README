------------------------------------------------

Welcome to reZet80!
reZet80 stands for "Reset me back to the 80s with the Z80".
reZet80 features a set of retro projects to develop computing and
arcade systems that resemble the Z80 machines of the late 70s and early 80s.
All systems are built from scratch and not copies of any other Z80 system.
The development process includes hardware design and low-level software
programming in Assembler. I will develop and build every single pcb trace
and every single bit of machine code by myself.
DIYIB: Doing it yourself is believing!
And WYDYIWYG: What you do yourself is what you get!
I started reZet80 back in 2016.

The reZet80 SCOUT is a minimalistic single-board computer (SBC).
It is equipped with a Z80 CPU, 1 KiB of static RAM and 2 or 4 KiB of ROM
containing a simple debug monitor.
Two 8-bit I/O ports connect to a 20-key keypad as default input and a
2-digit 7-segment display as default output.
You can also attach other peripherals to both I/O ports.
The board also includes power supply sockets and on/off and reset switches.
The reZet80 SCOUT is the little sister/brother of the reZet80 PIONEER.
If you need more RAM or ROM or better expansion capabilities use the
reZet80 PIONEER.

A minimal amount of NMOS and LSTTL chips that were available in the mid to
late 70s are used in this project:
- Zilog Z80 (CPU, NMOS, 1976)
- Intel 2114 or compatible (1K x 4 bit static RAM, NMOS, 1976)
- Intel 2125 or compatible (1K x 1 bit static RAM, NMOS, 1976, alternative to 2114)
- Intel 2716 or compatible (2 KiB UV erasable EPROM, NMOS, 1977)
- Intel 2732 or compatible (4 KiB UV erasable EPROM, NMOS, 1978, alternative to 2716)
- 74LS139 (memory and I/O decoding, LSTTL, 1975)
- 74LS244 (input and output ports, LSTTL, 1976)
