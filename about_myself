About myself
------------

The Spectravideo SV-328 was my first (8-bit) computer.
In the 80s I loved assembler programming for the Z80 and arcade games.
I started the reZet80 project back in 2016.
This is my first endeavor at electronics.
My interests: retrocomputing and retrogaming, coding in assembler.
